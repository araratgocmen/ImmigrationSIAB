Paper: "The Impact of Immigration along the Distribution of Native Wages: Evidence from Germany in the 2000s"

Abstract: Given inelastic labor supplies for different skill groups and an elastic capital supply, theory predicts that immigration decreases native wages for groups in which immigrants are overrepresented compared to natives, and increases them for those in which immigrants are underrepresented. I provide empirical evidence for this theory in the case of the immigration waves into Germany that began in 2011, which by 2017 raised the immigrant share of the full-time labor force in the former states of West Germany (excluding Berlin) by almost 3 percentage points. I first demonstrate that immigrants are more likely than natives to work in lower-wage occupations, such that immigrants are overrepresented below the first quartile of the native wage distribution and underrepresented above it. Immigrant downgrading amplifies these disparities, as immigrants earn lower wages compared even to natives of similar qualifications. I then estimate the impact of immigration on different percentiles of the native wage distribution. My findings are consistent with both theory and the evidence of downgrading: the impact is negative below the first quartile and positive above it. Causal identification is achieved by differencing across time to eliminate regional fixed effects, and by instrumenting the change in the immigrant-to-native ratio by its lagged level to account for various sources of bias. Based on this identification strategy, the recent immigration waves increased inequality in the bottom half of the native wage distribution in the average West German state, widening the wage differential between native workers at the median and 5th percentile by about 6%.
